### Hi there 👋

I'm Ritika Motwani 🐈, a passionate Computer Science enthusiast with a focus on building scalable web applications 🖥️ and data infrastructure 🌐. I was promoted to be the tech lead of the team in my previous company based on my performance and problem solving abilities. I have completed my Master's in Computer Science 👩‍🎓 from New York University (2024), and I'm excited about delving deeper into distributed systems and big data processing. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the AI for Medical Physics Lab at Stanford building a gene analysis software (in an end to end fashion with adding ML models to the applications, improving the API processing time for the APIs analysing the data through models and then running some business logic, working on infra, writing CI/CD pipelines for deployment and using serverless functions with GPU)  - https://analyxus.com/

I also have experience of building research prototypes from scratch and diving into new technologies. I have specifically helped with audio signal processing, transcriptions and diarizations at Princeton and NTU, Singapore. 🔭

During my Masters I learnt a lot about 
- CUDA, GPU (https://github.com/GPU-Project/GPU-L2-Cache-Management) and Multicore internals
- Big data processing
- Distributed systems (https://github.com/ritikamotwani/Go-And-Distributed-Systems)
- Cloud Computing (https://github.com/sameer7483/ML-models-in-Kubernetes-in-IBM-GCP-and-AWS)
- Advanced Database Systems (https://github.com/ritikamotwani/Replicated-Concurrency-Control-and-Recovery-)
- AI agentic Applications: I built a trip planner project with plan, stay, flights and shopping for the trip agents (https://github.com/ritikamotwani/Trip-Planner---Agentic-AI)


I am looking for opportunities to collaborate on related projects (systems, infra, full-stack for AI applications/agents and their deployments). Please reach out ⭐ incase you have any relevant projects where I can contribute. My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritika-motwani-47b770131/
